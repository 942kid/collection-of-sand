We recently (actually it should be "always") struggled a lot for keeping our
eat-out minimum.  But every now and then, we will go through the list of nearby
restaurants, hoping that something like Vegan Cuong or 675 would really happen
on Cambridge St.  

One day, this line in the supper menu of a nearby American restaurant saying

> All meats are humanely raised

caught our eyes.  Chendra and I wondered: how _meats_ can be _humanely_ raised?
It is common that people rationalize their deeds by stating them in a less
harsh way.  But this animal-welfarism statement, which will certainly please
most guests visiting the restaurant, sounds simply hilarious when giving it
a second thought.
