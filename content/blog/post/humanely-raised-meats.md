We recently (actually it should be "always") struggled a lot for keeping our
eat-out minimum.  But every now and then, we will go through the list of nearby
restaurants, hoping that something like Vegan Cuong or 675 would really happen
on Cambridge St.  

One day, a line in the supper menu of a nearby American restaurant caught our
eyes:  

> All meats are humanely raised.

Chendra and I wondered: how _meats_ can be _humanely_ raised? 

It is common that people rationalize their deeds by stating them in a less
harsh way.  The implication here is that it is OK to do whatever we want to
farm animals, as long as they are treated nicely when their meat is not ready
to harvest.  The restaurant guests would feel better about themselves when
eating the meats, because otherwise these animals would have lived terrible
lives on less humane factory farms. 

However, this animal-welfarism statement, which certainly pleases most guests
visiting the restaurant, sounds simply hilarious when giving it a second
thought.  It shamelessly admits that the farm animals, who are obviously
sentient beings (why do you care anyway if they cannot feel the pain?), are just
_meats_.  They may be running freely on the pasture, chewing happily their
grass, and even making eye contacts with you at the moment, but they are
_meats_, nothing more than the red and white things in the supermarket
shelves or the delicious objects on your plates.  What kind of humaneness is
this if it is only to exploit?
