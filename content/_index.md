Many times I have burned my personal website down to the earth. 

I can still recall my very first site named _Kid's Space Station_.  All I had
in that petty website were a bunch of pages created using FrontPage 98,
displaying carton figures that I cropped out of the screen-shots taken from the
games I played at that time, so as to allow others to download and used them to
replace the default desktop icons.  Of course, it never got published for we
did not have internet at home back in the 90's, and it is still rotting in the
grave of my old desktop with the beloved AMD K6-2.

Then it comes the age of static websites, in which the bar of making
a nice-looking personal site has never been lower.  However, more than a year
after the official release of blogdown, my website is still as bare-bone as
a demo could be, with two dummy posts full of cobwebs.  That is when I decide
to go bare-bone for real with [Nan's
hugo-renga](https://github.com/road2stat/hugo-renga), again. After all, with
few shiny projects to show off, the only thing that I can share is but
a collection of sand, like those carton figures who pose meaninglessly when
they are extracted out of the context, in this empty cyberspace, hoping someday
they will be found different and meaningful.
