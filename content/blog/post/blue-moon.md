I came across the news about Jeff Bezos launching a new moon lander, *Blue Moon*, today.
It generated a lot of excitement, indeed, about *staying* on the moon this time with the latest powerful rocket and lander.
Bezos talked about the tangible space tourism, and further depicted a blue print of a trillion people working and living in the space.
As always, resentment and reproach accompanied this move, with comments and retweets expressing concerns that it will only benefit the rich, who will abandon the planet they have already exploited to the last bit. 

What disturbed me, however, was not about the segregation of the rich and the mass, but the underlying humancentricness of both parties.
I do not think those who disapproved the enterprise won't do the same thing if they have billions at their disposal.
